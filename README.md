# Anvil Messaging
A library for [Anvil Applications](https://anvil.works) that provides publish-subscribe
messaging.

## Introduction
This library provides a mechanism for forms (and other components) within an Anvil app
to communicate in a 'fire and forget' manner.

It's an alternative to raising and handling events - instead you 'publish' messages to
a channel and, from anywhere else, you subscribe to that channel and process those
messages as required.

## Installation

  * In your anvil application, create a new module in the client code section and name it 'messaging'
  * Copy the entire content of `client_code/messaging.py` from this repository into your 'messaging' module

## Usage

### Create the Publisher
You will need to create an instance of the Publisher class somewhere in your application
that is loaded at startup.

For example, you might create a client module at the top level of your app called 'common'
with the following content:

```python
from .messaging import Publisher

publisher = Publisher()
```

and then import that module in your app's startup module/form.

### Publish Messages
From anywhere in your app, you can import the publisher and publish messages to a channel.
e.g. Let's create a simple form that publishes a 'hello world' message when it's initiated:

```python
from ._anvil_designer import MyPublishingFormTemplate
from .common import publisher


class MyPublishingForm(MyPublishingFormTemplate):

    def __init__(self, **properties):
        publisher.publish(channel="general", title="Hello world")
        self.init_components(**properties)
```

The publish method also has an optional 'content' parameter which can be passed any object.

### Subscribe to a Channel
Also, from anywhere in your app, you can subscribe to a channel on the publisher by
providing a handler function to process the incoming messages.

The handler will be passed a Message object, which has the title and content of the
message as attributes.

e.g. On a separate form, let's subscribe to the 'general' channel and print any 'Hello
world' messages:

```python
from ._anvil_designer import MySubscribingFormTemplate
from .common import publisher


class MySubscribingForm(MySubscribingFormTemplate):
    
    def __init__(self, **properties):
	publisher.subscribe(
	    channel="general", subscriber=self, handler=self.general_messages_handler
	)
        self.init_components(**properties)

    def general_messages_handler(self, message):
	if message.title = "Hello world":
	    print(message.title)
```

You can unsubscribe from a channel using the publisher's `unsubscribe` method. 

You can also remove an entire channel using the publisher's `close_channel` method.

Be sure to do one of these if you remove instances
of a form as the publisher will hold references to those instances and the handlers will
continue to be called.

### Logging
By default, the publisher will log each message it receieves to your app's logs (and
the output pane if you're in the IDE). 

You can change this default behaviour when you first create your publisher instance:


```python
from .messaging import Publisher

publisher = Publisher(with_logging=False)
)
```

The `publish`, `subscribe`, `unsubscribe` and `close_channel` methods each take an 
optional `with_logging` parameter which can be used to override the default behaviour.
